In December 2019, the company was converted into a corporation. Emerald Trade is now a holding company for emeralds held in Bank of America vaults for safekeeping, as well as an asset-backed digital currency and management company. Moreover, its business consists of purchasing at a significant discount premium-quality cut emeralds from reputable, vetted sellers in the major mining countries. 

Initially, FuraCoin will be a utility token, with a total supply of 600 million tokens.  There are currently 300 million Furacoin tokens created which are located on Etherscan.  It is part of our plan to create 300 million more Furacoin tokens to complete the figure of 600 million Furacoin Tokens that establishes the total supply.

Additionally, we will accumulate sufficient funds over time, with the ultimate goal of transitioning from a utility token to a coin by establishing our own blockchain network.  This will allow us to transact on our own network, which will allow us to have lower fees, expedited transaction times, and support for other ABTs via other stablecoins.  As exceptional as the Ethereum blockchain is and how widely used it is in the digital currency space, most things do not come without flaws.  If FuraCoin were to rely solely on the Ethereum network and massive traffic issues arose, the conduct of our business could be limited.  It would be foolish not to have our own blockchain network in case of a catastrophe.  We hope to achieve the same results with emeralds that we intend to achieve with other precious stones/metals in the future through our own blockchain network.
